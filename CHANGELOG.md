## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `bspctl layers` command to inspect which git revisions back each synced layer without running a full build.
- Added `bspctl for-all <cmd>` command to run a shell command across every cloned source repository, exporting `BSPCTL_REPO_NAME`, `BSPCTL_REPO_PATH`, and `BSPCTL_REPO_COMMIT` per invocation; exits non-zero if any repo fails while still visiting all repos.
- Added `bspctl settings` subcommand (`list`, `get`, `set`, `unset`) for managing `~/.config/bspctl/config.toml` without hand-editing; unknown keys and type mismatches are rejected with a non-zero exit.
- Added `bspctl diff <old> <new>` to compare layer SHAs between two NXP/TI manifest XMLs or delegate to `kas diff` for BYO/bbsetup configs.
- Added `bspctl prefetch` to run `bitbake --runall=fetch` through the existing kas environment, enabling offline source population without a full build.
- Added `bspctl dump` to print or stream the fully resolved kas YAML (after include expansion and overlay merging) to stdout or a file.
- Added `bspctl lock` to pin floating layer SHAs: wraps `repo manifest -r` for NXP workspaces and `kas lock` for BYO/bbsetup/TI.
- Added `bspctl report [run-id]` to display a post-build summary (image size, duration, layer state) in human-readable or `--json` form, resolving the latest run when no ID is given.
- Added `bspctl clean-sstate` for age-based sstate-cache pruning (default 30 days, dry-run by default; `--yes` deletes). Automatically detects `noatime` mounts and falls back to mtime-based pruning with a warning.
- Added `bspctl hashserv` subcommand (`start`, `stop`, `status`) for explicit lifecycle control of a persistent per-workspace `bitbake-hashserv` daemon; `bspctl build` auto-starts the daemon when `build.hashserv = true` is set in config.
- Added seven new `[build]` config keys accessible via `bspctl settings`: `dl_dir`, `sstate_dir`, `sstate_mirrors`, `scheduler`, `pressure_max_cpu`, `pressure_max_io`, and `pressure_max_memory`. Integer keys are stored as integers (not strings) in config.toml.
- Added `--psi-calibrate` flag to `bspctl doctor` to sample CPU/IO/memory pressure at 0.5 s intervals and recommend `pressure_max_*` thresholds at peak + 20% headroom.
- Added new `bspctl doctor` pre-flight checks: PSI kernel support, git global identity (honoring `includeIf` conditionals), kas YAML syntax, workspace filesystem hardlink safety, Docker version (≥ 20.10) and storage driver (`overlay2`), ccache fill level, and persistent hashserv reachability.
- Added a `bspctl-tuning-hashequiv.yml` opt-in overlay enabling OEEquivHash with a local `BB_HASHSERVE`; when `build.hashserv = true` is configured, bspctl automatically appends this overlay (deduplicating if the user also passes it explicitly).
- Added per-command documentation under `docs/` and a navigation index at `docs/index.md`; README condensed to a quickstart with a commands table.

### Changed
- Raised minimum Python version to 3.14; Python 3.12 and 3.13 are no longer supported.
- Log output from the Rich console now goes to stderr, keeping stdout clean for commands like `gen-kas` that emit machine-readable text.
- `bspctl doctor` git identity check now runs from the workspace directory so `includeIf "gitdir:..."` conditionals are honoured; a false BLOCK no longer fires for developers using per-project git identities.
- `BB_DISKMON_DIRS` in all tuning overlays updated from deprecated `ABORT` keyword to `HALT` (required for Yocto scarthgap and later).
- All tuning overlays now set `BB_HASHSERVE_UPSTREAM = ""` to prevent silent build hangs when the container cannot reach the public Yocto hash equivalence server.
- `bspctl clean --all` now gracefully stops the persistent hashserv daemon before wiping the workspace, preventing SQLite WAL corruption.
- Settings config file is now written atomically (temp file + replace) to prevent truncation on crash.
- `for-all` now catches `OSError` from subprocess invocation so a removed or inaccessible repo directory counts as a failure and the loop continues to remaining repos.

### Fixed
- Fixed `bspctl report` crashing with `UnboundLocalError` on NXP/TI workspaces due to the `family` variable being read before assignment.
- Fixed `bspctl diff` silently treating BYO kas configs as empty NXP manifests; dispatch now keys on file type (`.xml` → structural diff, everything else → `kas diff`).
- Fixed `bspctl doctor` kas-yaml-syntax check incorrectly returning FAIL for a valid YAML when the remote branch was rebased; the check now returns SKIP so the subsequent sync step can repair git state.
- Fixed `bspctl doctor` kas-yaml-syntax error message showing an irrelevant INFO log line instead of the actual ERROR message.
- Fixed exception handling in the disk-usage sampler that was silently swallowing programmer errors; narrowed to `(SubprocessError, OSError, ValueError)` and logs only the first failure instead of flooding the run log.
- Fixed `triage` not finding run directories for meta-avocado workspaces (builds land in `build-<stem>/build/runs/`).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added support for **bitbake-setup workspaces** as a new BSP family (`bbsetup`). `bspctl` now auto-detects a bitbake-setup workspace from the current
directory, translates its `config-upstream.json` and `sources-fixed-revisions.json` into a `kas-bbsetup.yml`, and routes `gen-kas`, `build`, `doctor`, and
`triage` subcommands accordingly.
- `bspctl gen-kas` regenerates `kas-bbsetup.yml` from a bitbake-setup workspace's resolved configuration, pinning each layer repository to its fixed-revision
SHA.
- `bspctl build` now runs the kas pipeline on bitbake-setup workspaces using the generic tuning overlay without requiring a manifest file or YAML argument.
- `bspctl doctor` now runs dedicated pre-flight checks for bitbake-setup workspaces, verifying that the workspace is initialized and that sources are present.
- `bspctl sync` on a bitbake-setup workspace now fails fast with guidance to use `bitbake-setup init` instead of silently attempting an unsupported sync.
- Generated and committed kas YAML files now declare configuration format version 21 (up from 3), compatible with kas 4.x and newer.

### Fixed

- Fixed a build failure that could occur when kas attempted to verify a pinned commit's reachability against a branch that had moved forward; commit-pinned
repos in the `bbsetup` kas translation now emit only the SHA, omitting the branch anchor.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Persistent user configuration via `~/.config/bspctl/config.toml` — set default machine, distro, image, manifest, repo URL, and container image without exporting environment variables on every shell session. An absent file falls back to built-in defaults and is never auto-created.
- `examples/config.toml` reference file with every available key commented out and annotated; copying it to `~/.config/bspctl/config.toml` is inert until a key is uncommented.
- `--show-layers` flag and `show_hashes` config key to print each layer's git short hash and branch after a build, mirroring what bitbake logs. The layers table now also includes the bitbake version.
- Layer hash collection now supports generic kas YAML builds that use `${TOPDIR}`-relative layer paths (e.g. `${TOPDIR}/../layers/<repo>`), in addition to the existing NXP/TI `/sources/`-based layout.
- `doctor` config key to suppress the pre-flight doctor check without passing `--skip-doctor` on every invocation.

### Changed

- Configuration resolution now follows a four-tier precedence chain: CLI flag → environment variable → `config.toml` → built-in default. Setting `container_image` in `config.toml` activates container mode (same behaviour as `KAS_CONTAINER_IMAGE`) and prints a notice so the switch is not silent.
- The container-bitbake doctor check now bind-mounts the workspace bitbake directory into the container when available, producing a real version string instead of an opaque "inspection failed" / SKIP result. When `which bitbake` returns a not-found message the check now reports "not in container PATH (workspace-sourced)" rather than a generic failure.
- A config file parse error now exits with code 2 and prints the file path, making misconfigured `config.toml` files immediately identifiable.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed
- `BB_NUMBER_THREADS` and `PARALLEL_MAKE` defaulted to 16 regardless of the host's CPU count. `_build_env()` now sets `NPROC` to `os.cpu_count()` before invoking kas, so the tuning overlay picks up the actual core count. Set `NPROC` explicitly to override.
- `bspctl doctor` now reports the effective `NPROC` value at pre-flight time via the new `nproc` INFO check.

## [0.2.0]

### Fixed
- Overlay YAMLs were missing from the published wheel: `overlays/` at repo root is not picked up by `uv_build`. Moved to `src/bspctl/overlays/` so the files are included as package data. Every prior release was broken - `bspctl build` raised `FileNotFoundError` on the first run.
- `_overlay_dir()` walked `__file__` three levels up to the repo root, producing a non-existent path under `site-packages/`. Replaced with `importlib.resources.files("bspctl") / "overlays"`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- `bspctl build --host` and `bspctl shell --host` flags bypass `kas-container` and run plain `kas`/`kas shell` directly on the host - no Docker required.
- Auto-detection: when `KAS_CONTAINER_IMAGE` is absent from the environment, host mode activates automatically. Set the variable to opt into container builds.
- Example kas YAML (`examples/kas-qemux86-64-wrynose.yml`) for a local, network-free wrynose (Yocto master) minimal build on qemux86-64 using repos from `~/repos/personal/yocto/`.

### Changed
- Releases are now driven by `scripts/release.sh`, which enforces an atomic bump+push (preconditions and validation gates run first, then `bump-my-version` and `git push --follow-tags` execute back-to-back with no opportunity to interleave commits).

## [0.0.3] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- First release published to PyPI. Install with `uv tool install bspctl` or `pip install bspctl`.
- Python 3.14 added to the supported version matrix (3.11–3.14).
- GitHub Actions CI workflow: test matrix across Python 3.11–3.14, ruff lint, ty type-check.
- Automated PyPI publishing via OIDC Trusted Publisher on version-tag push, with a GitHub release
  created from the matching CHANGELOG section.
- `RELEASING.md`: step-by-step release guide covering PyPI Trusted Publisher setup and the
  `bump-my-version` workflow.

### Changed
- Documentation leads with kas wrapper identity (four general capabilities); NXP/TI vendor
  manifest support is now presented as a secondary layer built on top.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-05-21

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Initial public release.
- NXP i.MX BSP support via Google `repo` + `var-setup-release.sh` + `kas-container`.
- TI Sitara BSP support via `varigit/oe-layersetup` + `kas-container`.
- Generic BYO kas YAML support for any non-NXP/TI build.
- Pre-flight `bspctl doctor` checks with BLOCK/WARN/INFO severity.
- Structured per-run observability under `<bsp_root>/build/runs/<ts>/` (events.jsonl, console.log, kas.log, env.txt, time.log, du.tsv).
- `bspctl triage` post-mortem with keyed failure-pattern suggestions.
- Vendor config layer at `~/.config/bspctl/vendors.toml` for custom board families.
