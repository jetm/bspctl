"""Unit tests for the host-mode exe selection inside ``run_build``.

``run_build()`` in :mod:`bspctl.steps.kas_build` chooses between ``kas`` and
``kas-container`` for the spawned child process based on
``cfg.host_mode``. Exercising the full ``run_build`` end-to-end is
impractical: it allocates a PTY, starts a daemon ``du`` sampler thread,
drives a Rich progress UI in the foreground, and depends on
``materialize_overlay``/``_resolve_user_yaml`` against a real bsp_root
tree. Mocking every side effect produces a test whose harness is larger
than the system under test.

These tests instead exercise the exe-selection expression directly on a
constructed ``BuildConfig`` (the same ``_make_cfg`` shape used by
``test_kas_env.py``), and verify the literal source line exists in
``kas_build.py`` so a future edit that drops the host-mode branch fails
loudly. The combination catches both behavioural regressions (the
expression returning the wrong value) and structural regressions (the
expression being removed or moved out of ``run_build``).
