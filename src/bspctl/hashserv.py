"""Workspace-scoped bitbake-hashserv daemon helpers.

This module owns the lifecycle of a per-workspace ``bitbake-hashserv``
daemon. A persistent daemon lets cross-build sstate hash equivalence
accumulate instead of being rebuilt from scratch on every ``bspctl
build`` (which is what ``BB_HASHSERVE = "auto"`` does).

The daemon binary is sourced exclusively from the synced workspace at
``<bsp_root>/sources/poky/bitbake/bin/bitbake-hashserv``. We deliberately
do NOT fall back to a host PATH lookup: the daemon's wire protocol must
match the bitbake the build will run against, and the workspace bitbake
is the only version we can guarantee that for.
