"""Per-layer SHA diff between two pinned manifests.

Compares two SHA-pinned ``repo`` manifest XMLs (as produced by ``bspctl
lock`` / ``repo manifest -r``) and reports, per layer, the old and new
SHA plus a best-effort commit count between them. The pin parsing reuses
:func:`bspctl.workspace.parse_manifest_pins`; the commit count is read
from ``git rev-list`` only when the layer checkout is present locally and
both SHAs are known. Git invocations never raise: a missing checkout or a
failed ``git`` command yields ``commit_count=None`` rather than an error.
